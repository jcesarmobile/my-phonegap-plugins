The plugin have been updated to use the latest iSpeech SDK and now it's CLI compatible.
It has it's own repository https://github.com/jcesarmobile/iSpeechPlugin

This version is still working but requires manual installation and the latest SDK should be downloaded from https://www.ispeech.org/developers/iphone to avoid app store rejections


iSpeech Plugin for TTS and Speech Recognition using iSpeech SDK

iSpeech configuration:

In your AppDelegate.m
Add this line
#import "iSpeechSDK.h"
and inside the init method configure your iSpeech key with this 2 lines of code:
iSpeechSDK *sdk = [iSpeechSDK sharedSDK]; 
sdk.APIKey = @"yourKeyGoesHere";
example, don't remove the existing phonegap code, just add the 2 lines before the self = [super init];
– - (id)init {
/** If you need to do any extra app-specific initialization, you can do it here * -jm **/
NSHTTPCookieStorage* cookieStorage = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage];
[cookieStorage setCookieAcceptPolicy:NSHTTPCookieAcceptPolicyAlways];
int cacheSizeMemory = 8 * 1024 * 1024; // 8MB
int cacheSizeDisk = 32 * 1024 * 1024; // 32MB NSURLCache* sharedCache = [[[NSURLCache alloc]
initWithMemoryCapacity:cacheSizeMemory diskCapacity:cacheSizeDisk diskPath:@"nsurlcache"] autorelease];
[NSURLCache setSharedURLCache:sharedCache];
iSpeechSDK *sdk = [iSpeechSDK sharedSDK];
    sdk.APIKey = @"yourKeyGoesHere";
self = [super init];
return self; }

Add this frameworks to your project AudioToolbox.framework, SystemConfiguration.framework, Security.framework, and CFNetwork.framework.

Download the iSpeech SDK or use the files from the sample project. You will need this files:
Headers folder:
Contains iSpeechSDK headers.
Drag it from your downloads or from the sample project, make sure the copy files if neccesary option is checked and the create groups option.
LibiSpeechSDK.a
Drag it from your downloads or from the sample project, make sure the copy files if neccesary option is checked and the create groups option.
IspeechSDK.bundle
Drag it from your downloads or from the sample project, make sure the copy files if neccesary option is checked and the create groups option.

Plugin specific configuration:
Drag the files
TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin.h
TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin.m to your phonegap Plugins folder
make sure the copy files if neccesary option is checked and the create groups option.
Inside config.xml

If using phonegap >= 3.0 
<feature name="TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin">
        <param name="ios-package" value="TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin" />
</feature>

If using phonegap < 3.0 add this line to the plugins section
<plugin name="TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin" value="TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin" />


put the TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin.js file inside your www folder and link it inside your index.html (see sample project)


Configuring the speech plugin:
Right now the plugin is very limited and you can't configure it from the javascript part, but you can configure it from the native part. There is how:

in the TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin.m
inside the speak function you can configure speed, bitrate, and voice:

Set voice:
example
[synthesis setVoice:ISVoiceEURSpanishMale];
see available voices inside IISpeechSynthesisVoices.h (Inside the Headers folder)

Set bitrate:
[synthesis setBitrate:48];
Valid values include 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 192, 224, 256, and 320

Set Speed:
example
[synthesis setSpeed:0]; Valid values from -10 to 10


Configuring the detection:
in the TTSAndSpeechRecognitionPlugin.m
inside the speak function you can configure silence detection, locale, and confidence:

silence detection: If YES it stops recognicing when detects silence, set to NO to make it stop when you push Done button or on the timeout.
[recognition setSilenceDetectionEnabled:YES];

locale: (language used to detect)
example
[recognition setLocale:ISLocaleESSpanish];
The available locales are inside ISSpeechRecognitionLocales.h (in headers folder) It might accept some ISO codes, but I think it's better using the ones in ISSpeechRecognitionLocales.h

confidence:
is the confidence of the recognition result, the value will be between 0.0 and 1.0 
I'm making the plugin to fail if confidence < 0.3
if (result.confidence < 0.3) {
[self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:[CDVPluginResult
resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_ERROR messageAsString:@"no confidence"] callbackId:command.callbackId];
}


How to use the plugin in javascript:
See example inside index.html

speak function:
window.TTSPlugin.speak(speakPluginResultHandler,nativePluginErrorHandler,”text you want the plugin to speak”);

recognize function:
window.TTSPlugin.recognize(recognizePluginResultHandler,nativePluginErrorHandler);
